HotSounds
=========
The HotSounds Show System is a sound application designed to put sounds from your computer at your finger tips. It initially was designed for theater students who need an easy and quick way to:

  *play dramatic music
  
  *gunshot

  *different gunshot

  *doorbell

  *first gunshot

  *fade out music

which is nearly impossible on a CD player, and iTunes for that matter. Using HotSounds, playing these sounds is as simple as:

  *press m

  *press g

  *press h

  *press d

  *press g

  *press down arrow

Please let me know what you think of this project!

*This is designed for small theaters, meaning that I don't want to try to get into microphones and balancing and etc.
