HotSounds
=========
The HotSounds Show System is a sound application designed to put sounds from your computer at your finger tips. It initially was designed for theater students who need an easy and quick way to:

  gunshot

  different gunshot

  doorbell

  first gunshot

  play music and fade out

which is nearly impossible on a CD player, and iTunes for that matter. Using HotSounds, playing these sounds is as simple as:

  press g

  press h

  press d

  press g

  press m

  <wait for a little while until you want the fade out to start>

  press down arrow

This application accomplishes these tasks using the Java Audio classes, so there is an unfortunate ~.25sec delay between asking a sound to go quiet or change, and that change happening. (Sounds do play instantly, however)

Please let me know what you think of this project!

*This is designed for small theaters, meaning that I don't want to try to get into microphones and balancing and etc.
